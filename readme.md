This is an example Profit and Loss Report for the finance/accounting application.
The backend, which supplies the data, is proprietary and cannot be hosted on github.

The dummy data is included so that the user can experience what the basic functionality is.
In this application, the data is provided from a report object built from MySql and Php.
The inputs for the backend include a user interface for entering journal entries and
an API to collect sales and transaction data from various sources, such as banks, credit cards,
online marketplaces and e-commerce platforms.

Report features:
Parent expenses can drill-down for further details. (click)
Expenses display a percentage of revenue and percent of total expenses. (hover)
Report date ranges can be set to compare time periods (not available without backend processing)
